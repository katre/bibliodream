About the broad and spacious grounds festooned

As I suggested in our study of

malnutrition of structures (the myocardium, valves and arteries)

of metabolism in the cardiac and arterial walls, which are fed with
gouty blood, there is the damaging effect on them of similar disease
of the _vasa vasorum_ and _vasa cordis_ or coronaries.[13] Besides
a distressing feeling of irregularity, fluttering or intermittency,
and dyspnœa on exertion, men who are the subjects of gouty heart

To touch upon the subject as lightly as space
will permit, we can probably do no better than to suggest the obvious
type of mantel for one or two of the more common architectural styles,
and recommend that in other styles the architect be allowed sufficient
latitude in design and expense to distinguish this important feature of

   Came voices of the well-contented
             doves."

Doves and wood-pigeons are almost as abundant in England as hares 
and rabbits, and are also a serious annoyance to the farmer; while 
in this country the dove and pigeon are much less marked and 
permanent features in our rural scenery,--less permanent, except in 
the case of the mourning dove, which is found here and there the 
season through; and less marked, except when the hordes of the 
passenger pigeon once in a decade or two invade the land, rarely 
tarrying longer than the bands of a foraging army.

Bonaparte then convoked upon the spot a

It is therefore evident that the prodigious chain of mountains which run
from the West to the East in the old continent, and from the North to
the South in the new, must have been produced by the general motion of
the tides; but the origin of all the inferior mountains must be
attributed to the particular motions of currents, occasioned by the
winds and other irregular agitations of the sea: they may probably have
been produced by a combination of all those motions, which must be
capable of infinite variations, since the winds and different positions
of islands and coasts change the regular course of the tides, and compel
them to flow in every possible direction: it is, therefore, not in the
least astonishing that we should see considerable eminences, whose
courses have no determined direction.

During the day they had passed several bodies of Mahratta

most formidable opponent, as occupying a place in the country and in the
allegiance of the majority of Englishmen which otherwise could only have
been filled by the older Church: the other looking more at the
resemblances between the two Churches, held the opinion that little was
needed to bring the Established Church into communion and submission to
the Papal See, and by that means, at once, and without trouble, restore
the papal authority in England.

A study of the

This plan completely answered the

The moon draws this out by sympathy, so that they burst forth on the

The Two Tribes in their dispersion over wide Europe carried their
worship, their language, and their manners, into every European city,
and synagogues exist to this day which were set up centuries before
Christ, and every European Jew can tell for certain that he is a
descendant of Abraham, and lives apart from the Gentiles around; yet, if
the Anglo-Israelite theory be true, the Ten Tribes poured in upon Great
Britain and settled themselves there, drove back the Aborigines, but
left their religion, their books, their priesthood, their language,
their names behind them, like cast-off clothes, in order to prevent
themselves from being identified, as if ashamed of their ancestry.

When the development of wealth and commerce brought these diversified
cultures into friendly intercourse with one another, the exchange of
ideas and the general imitation of the useful arts of one people by its
neighbours must have made very strongly for progress; the culture of
each of a group of neighbouring peoples no longer progressed only by the
addition of the ideas and inventions of its own exceptional intellects,
but each group had the opportunity of selecting and imitatively adopting
whatever seemed to them best among the ideas, the arts and inventions of
the neighbouring peoples.

agitation and the heat of the sun alters the natural taste which the sea
should have; and the different colour of different seas, at different

generally-received opinion at Paris was, that he was at one time butler
to King Pharaoh; and that, after lying asleep for four thousand years in
a place called the Kattycombs, he was awaked by the sound of Nelson’s
cannon, at the Battle of the Nile; and going to the shore, took on with
the admiral, and became, in course of time, ship steward; and that after
Nelson’s death, he was captured by the French, on board one of whose
vessels he served in a somewhat similar capacity till the peace, when he
came to Paris, and set up an ordinary for servants, sticking the name of
Katcomb over the door, in allusion to the place where he had his long
sleep.

see that the episcopal judge did not begin the trial with tortures

Let us ask ourselves in the closet whether, after we have
humbled ourselves before God in our prayers, we never rise beyond the due
standard in the pulpit; whether our zeal for the truth be never
over-heated by internal fires less holy; whether we never grow stiffly
and sternly pertinacious, at the very time when we are reproving the
obstinacy of others; and whether we have not frequently so acted as if we
believed that opposition were to be relaxed and borne away by
self-sufficiency and intolerance.

It is a burning shame that the great life-work of one of the most

AN OLD YOUNG HUSBAND AND WIFE


It was the year 1818, I will not say of happy memory, because I do not
remember whether that year was happier than other years; probably it was
so to certain people, and just the opposite to others; and sometimes,
often, I may say almost always, the same cause produces contrary
results; that is to say, the thing that causes one person’s happiness
causes the unhappiness of another person.

It seems that medicine was not taught formally until so ordered, in 805,
by Charlemagne; probably by the advice of Alcuin, the founder of the
learned tradition at Fulda, the founder, we may almost say, of the
neo-latin period, and some time headmaster of my own school of St Peter
at York.

However, the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestow the

When Torricelli, for
example,--proceeding on the observation previously made, by Galileo,
with respect to the limited height to which water could be made to rise

after so many ages of errors, what ought not for a single moment to
have required to be demonstrated; the absurdity of the horror of a void
ascribed to nature--when, proceeding in this memorable observation,
Torricelli made his equally memorable experiment with respect to the
height of the column of mercury supported in an inverted tube, and
found, on comparison of their specific gravities, the columns of
mercury and water to be exactly equiponderant, it is evident that he
was led to the experiment with the mercury by the supposition, that
the rise of fluids _in vacuo_ was occasioned by some counterpressure,
exactly equal to the weight supported, and that the column of mercury,
therefore should be less in height than the column of water, in
the exact inverse ratio of their specific gravities, by which the
counterpressure was to be sustained.

the end of the world will know me no more; the fields and hedgerows,
grass and leaf stiff with the crisp rime of winter’s breath, lie beyond
my horizon; the ewes in the folding, their mysterious eyes quick with the

Few of the formal definitions of
units of measurement, now to be found in the pages of every elementary

Callynge vnto me dame sapyence shortely

Saynge vnto her o lady and maystres
O comfortable salue vnto euery sore
O fontayne of welth and carbuncle of clernes
Without ye helpe me I am forlore
Wherfore I shewe you as now before
Without I mary fayre dame clennes
I shall endure in mortall heuynes

Therof sayd she be no thynge adred
For ye shall mary here ryght soone
By me your mater shall be well sped
And the same daye it shall be doone
Aboute the houre truely of noone
And there shall be at your good dyner
Charyte fayth penaunce and prayer

Dame sapyence led me into a gardeyn
Where Clennes was amonge floures swete
Her to repayre without dysdeyn
As I to her wente she dyd me mete
Bryngynge me a floure called the margarete
Whiche is a floure ryght swete and precyous
Indued with beaute and moche vertuous

This floure I kyst often ryght swetely
Settynge it nere vnto my hert
Dame Clennes loked vpon me louely
Saynge that I sholde not depert
Tyll she had shewed me a grete couert
So with her I wente without delay
Where byrdes sate on many a spray

By this tyme phebus had begon
His ascencyall cours in grete bryghtnes
In to the sygne of the fierous lyon
Exylynge the fenerous frosty coldnes
And depryuynge the noxyall derkenes
And also setherus his fragraunt breth
Dystylled had vpon euery heth

Than to her I sayd my lady dere
Beholde this weder so clere and fayre
How royall walkynge that it is here
Lyke a place of pleasure you to repayre
Amonge the floures so swete of ayre
An other she had as she me tolde
Bryghter than phebus a thousande folde

This is a place of recreacyon
My mynde to comfort after study
In welth pleasure and delectacyon
For yf I sholde my selfe applye
Euer to pray to god an hye
Without this place I may not be sure
In other tyme in prayer to endure

But the other gardyn is celestyall
That longeth to vs by enherytaunce
And is entayled to vs in generall
For our clene lyfe & vertuous gouernaũce
Who that vs loueth without doubtaũce
With vs shall go to eternall glory
In short space or elles to purgatory

Than forth we went to her fader royall
Whiche welcomed vs by grete humylyte
Saynge my doughter dere and specyall
Ye shall this daye by grete solempnyte
Be wedded to vertue with benygnyte
We kneled downe and thanked his grace
And than forth we went to an other place
